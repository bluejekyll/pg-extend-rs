//! Implements macros for the PostgreSQL logging system.
//!
//! For common log levels, convenient macros are implemented: [`trace!`], [`debug!`], [`log!`],
//! [`info!`], [`notice!`], [`warn!`], [`error!`], [`fatal!`].
//!
//! Other log levels are supported with the generic macro [`pg_log!`]. See the [`Level` enum] for
//! all available log levels.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! Beware, log levels `ERROR` and higher also abort the current transaction. The PostgreSQL
//! implementation uses exception handling with `longjmp`, which currently has unsafe side-effects.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use pg_extend::{info, pg_log};
//! use pg_extend::log::Level;
//!
//! info!("{} widgets frobnicated", 10);
//! pg_log!(Level::LogServerOnly, "Big brother is watching {}!", "you");
//! ````
//!
//! # Rust `log` crate
//!
//! The macro names make this mostly a drop-in replacement for the Rust `log` crate. However, there
//! are differences:
//! * Due to PostgreSQL behavior, log levels `ERROR` and higher log levels abort the current
//!   statement and transaction.
//! * `pg_extend` macros do not support the optional `target:` argument.
//! * In the `log` crate, the generic logging macro is called `log!`. However, we use that name as a
//!   specialized macro since PostgreSQL has a `LOG` log level.
//! * `Level` enum contains Postgres-specific log levels; there is no `Level::Trace` for instance.
